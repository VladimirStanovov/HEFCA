Hybrid Evolutionary Fuzzy Classification Algorithm


This code implements a classification method that uses fuzzy logic apparatus and learns classification fuzzy rule bases from data. Algorithm also implements instance selection approach, and is capable of processing relatively large datasets (millions of instances). The whole project is in C++.
